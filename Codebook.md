This data set is the result of the transformation of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" as the project assignment. The original data were collected on volunteers, wearing Smartphone Samsung Galaxy S II on the waist and performing six different activities: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

For the details please see [here.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The Samsung smartphone possess a accelerometer and gyroscope. 

The collected data describes 3-axial linear acceleration (variables with "Acc" in their names) and 3-axial angular velocity (those with "Gyro" in their names) at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The variables with "Jerk" in their names describes the swing movements detected from both accelerometer and gyroscope. 

The name parts "Body" or "Gravity" shows the art of the signal detected. 

The name part "Mag" describes the magnitude. 

The name part "X", "Y" or "Z" shows the direction of the signal.

Only the mean values (name part "mean") and standard deviations (name part "std") were used for the purpose of the actual assignment.

The transformation of the original data set is described in the file readme.md in the same directory as this file.
